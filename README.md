**Sample rate:** 24kHz<br>
**Steps:** 330,000<br>
**Pretrained model:** None<br>

**3 hours and 10 minutes of audio data**

⋅⋅* Combination of english, tagalog and japanese singing audio data<br>
⋅⋅* Speech audio data of english and tagalog<br>
⋅⋅* UTAU audio samples of C3 and C4<br>

**I do not use this as a pretrain model because it's often unstable**

**I do not suggest to use this as a pretrain model because it's often unstable.

But if you are going to use this for pretraining, you need to take note of these:

- Properly credit this model and the creator of the model because the audio date came from my own voice.
- Do not** release** a model that was pretrained using this model with sombody's voice (celebrities, politicians, strangers, friends, etc) without the voice providers' **consent/permission**. 

**Credit me if you use him because the audio data came from my own voice**
